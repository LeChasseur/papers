abstract={In recent times, use of third-party libraries has become prevalent practice in contemporary software development. Much like other code components, unmaintained libraries are a cause for concern, especially when it risks code degradation over time. Therefore, awareness of when a library should be updated is important. With the emergence of large libraries hosting repositories such as Maven Central, we can leverage the dynamics of these ecosystems to understand and estimate when a library is due for an update. In this paper, based on the concepts of software aging, we empirically explore library usage as a means to describe its age. The study covers about 1,500 libraries belonging to the Maven software ecosystem. Results show that library usage changes are not random, with 81.7% of the popular libraries fitting typical polynomial models. Further analysis show that ecosystem factors such as emerging rivals has an effect on aging characteristics. Our preliminary findings demonstrate that awareness of library aging and its characteristics is a promising step towards aiding client systems in the maintenance of their libraries.},
